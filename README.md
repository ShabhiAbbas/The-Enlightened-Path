# The-Enlightened-Path
A 2D maze exploration game developed in C++ with SFML for the OOP course. The player navigates a procedurally generated maze with limited visibility, solves riddles to expand their vision radius, and races to reach the end. Includes recursive-backtracking maze generation, collision detection, fog-of-war lighting, and a local leaderboard.
